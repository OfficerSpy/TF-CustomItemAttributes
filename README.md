# TF-CustomItemAttributes
Custom item attributes that can be used in TF2.

This is an implementation of a [certain mod](https://github.com/rafradek/sigsegv-mvm)'s custom attributes, along with other community suggestions.

## Requirements
* [[TF2] TF2Attributes](https://github.com/FlaminSarge/tf2attributes)
* [TF2 Utils](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFUtils)

You will also need a mod that can inject custom attributes into the game. Here are some examples:
* [TF2 Hidden Attribuites](https://github.com/rafradek/TF2-Hidden-Attributes)
* [TF2 Econ Dynamic](https://github.com/nosoop/SMExt-TFEconDynamic)
